# Lecture 1: Introduction and Overview

Sept. 8, 2016 at 12:41 PM

This course is about quantum computers (duh)!

## Quantum Mechanics

- The **Mathematical Formalism ** for quantum mechanics was developed around 1925 by _Schrodinger _ and _Heisenberg_ 
- However, even before that, work had been done in the field by Planck
- They realized that particles/quanta exist, and have wave-like properties (such as frequency)
- They also learned that physics on a small scale is probablistic **and** destructive
- The lecture emphasized the fact that we need to trust our intuition, and that it is ear impossible for humans at our developemental stages to fully understand the nature of quantum mechanics. Many great quantum physicists themselves don't even fully believe in quantum mechanics.
-  **Hilbert Space -** A complete vector space equipped with an inner product. This gets complicated with infinite dimensions, but we will be working in finite dimensions, so this is not so horrible.
- A wave function will describe the probability that a particle is at a certain location:

- However, the wave function may have **multiple peaks** , meaning that an electron may "be in two places at the same time." This behavior is what allows us to create **qubits.** 

## Computers

- A computer is something that stores information and processes information
- Even a molecule is a computer! It can hold a state and react to instructions that are sent to it.
- But wait a minute... in order to represent a complex number at perfect precision, don't you need an infinite number of bits?
	- Not quite ... but wait for that answer
	- "Quantum mechanics makes nature digital" because of these **quanta**
